Introduction
------------

This directory contains source and documentation for Tksh, an
implementation of the Tcl C library on top of the Kornshell
API.  Tksh allows Tcl libraries such as Tk to run on top of
ksh93 without modification, and will also interpret Tcl
scripts.  Tcl version 7.6 is implemented.  Tk version 4.2
is provided with Tksh.

Documentation
-------------

This directory contains the man page for tksh ("tksh.1").
To print the man page, use troff with the normal -man macros:
	troff -man tksh.1

A paper describing Tksh is available on the Tksh homepage,
as well as more up to date information.  The URL is:
	http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jlk/tksh


Prerequisites
-------------

Tksh requires that you have the AST libraries (libshell.a,
libcmd.a and libast.a) and required header files.  Tksh
requires nmake to build, which is also part of the AST
package.  If you do not have this software, you can obtain
a copy at:

	http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/reuse

You should be using ksh93e or later (Tksh will also work with
ksh93d, but is less stable and requires the object file "main.o"
from the ksh distribution).

Installing Tksh
---------------

Tksh will install with any ANSI C compiler (tested with gcc) and
nmake.   Typing "nmake" will run the configuration script and compile
Tksh.  If compilation is succesful, you can try out tksh by running
the binary "tksh" in the compile directory.

There is a demo that you can run (the standard Tk demo) by typing
	./tksh widget

To install tksh, run:
	nmake all install INSTALLROOT=directory-name
Tksh will place the binary under $INSTALLROOT/bin
and libraries under $INSTALLROOT/lib

Examples
--------

In the "scripts" directory, there are a couple of example scripts
written in Tksh.  The script "watchdir" is a good example
of using shell and Tk together.  It should be run interactively
(by using the "." command in ksh).  The script "mailfile" is
a script that implements an open file dialog box and allows the
user to email a file or directory.

The directory desksh contains an example of a desktop environment
written with Tksh.  This is a work in progress.

Debugging
---------

To compile a version for debugging, define "DEBUG".  If Tksh is
compiled as a debug version, setting the environment variable
"TKSHDEBUG" (for example, by running the command as "TKSHDEBUG=1 ./tksh")
will cause Tksh to print (many!) debug messages to stderr.

Bugs
----

Send bug reports to me (jlk@research.att.com).  I'll try to fix
problems when I can, but I don't have too much time to support
this software.  Please include as much information as possible
in your bug report.
