.H 1 std
The
.B ast
.B std
commands are re-implementations of some of the standard section
.B 1
commands.
On most systems the
.B mount
and
.B ps
commands are installed as
.B ast_mount
and
.B ast_ps
because the author either could not keep up with option proliferation or
the commands must be installed with sufficient privelege to operate
multi-user.
