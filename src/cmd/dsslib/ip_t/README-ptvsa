prefix tables of addresses with arbitrary size.  In particular, ptv
supports ipv4 and ipv6 prefix table set operations.

This directory contains ptvsa, the standalone code for ptv.  ptvsa
requires the ast standalone astsa source package.  Read this package
and astsa in the same directory and run this to build libptvsa.a:

	make -f ptvsa.omk

and this to build the test harness and test the library:

	make -f ptvsa.omk test

You may have to do some /bin/make plumbing on *.omk to get it to work
on your system.

The library interface is implemented in libptvsa.a; include ptv.h in your
source and link your a.out with libptvsa.a.  ptvsa.omk (for old make) pulls
in standalone headers and source.

'testptv --man' lists the test harness man page on the standard error.
ptv.3 is the api man page. See testptv.c for example api usage.

ptvsa is a subset of the { ast-base ast-dss } packages at
